  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Terms & Conditions</h2>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>FanMeetZone</strong>. These Terms & Conditions outline the rules and policies
     governing all payments and activities on our platform. By continuing to payment, you agree to
     these terms in full.</p>

  <h3>1. Payments & Processing</h3>
  <p>All payments made through FanMeetZone are securely processed. Once confirmed, transactions are
     immediately submitted for settlement and cannot be modified. Ensure all information, including
     package type and contact details, are correct before confirming.</p>

  <h3>2. No Refunds Policy</h3>
  <p>Due to the digital and personalized nature of our services (including meet-and-greets,
     video calls, or personalized content), all sales are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>.
     Refunds will only be issued if a duplicate charge occurs due to a verified system error.</p>

  <h3>3. Cancellations & Rescheduling</h3>
  <p>FanMeetZone reserves the right to reschedule any event or interaction due to technical issues
     or changes from the participating celebrity. In such cases, the booking will be moved to the
     next available date, but no refunds will be provided.</p>

  <h3>4. User Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Users must provide accurate personal details. FanMeetZone is not responsible for losses arising
     from incorrect email addresses, payment details, or incomplete forms.</p>

  <h3>5. Fraud & Verification</h3>
  <p>To protect both clients and celebrities, FanMeetZone may require additional verification before
     completing transactions. Failure to comply may result in the cancellation of the booking without
     refund.</p>

  <h3>6. Liability Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>FanMeetZone provides its services “as-is.” We are not responsible for technical interruptions,
     third-party delays, or the inability to complete a meet-and-greet due to factors beyond our control.</p>

  <h3>7. Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>All disputes must be submitted to <strong>support@fanmeetzone.com</strong> within 48 hours of the issue.
     Disputes submitted after this window may not be reviewed.</p>
